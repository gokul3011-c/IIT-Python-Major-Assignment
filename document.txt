Samraksha
Prescription Verification System

Problem Statement
Fake and invalid medical prescriptions are increasingly becoming a significant issue. They
pose risks to patients, contribute to drug misuse. Existing methods, such as handwritten
prescriptions, QR codes, and electronic prescriptions lack sufficient security. These can be
easily replicated or forged, and they do not consistently verify the authenticity of the
prescription or its association with the correct individual. This situation complicates trust for
both pharmacists and patients regarding the validity of prescriptions. Therefore, there is an
urgent need for a secure, identity-based, and user-friendly digital system to verify the
authenticity of prescriptions.

Proposed Solution
Samraksha is an innovative prescription verification system that utilizes dynamic, encrypted
barcodes to guarantee the uniqueness, timeliness, and connection of each prescription to
the patient's Aadhaar or mobile number. Samraksha falls under Sustainable Development
Goal (SDG) 3: Good Health and Well-Being.

Key Features





Dynamic and Encrypted Barcodes: Safeguard against duplication and forgery.
Aadhaar-linked Identity: Guarantees secure and verifiable prescriptions.
Universal Access: The same web application functions on both desktops and mobile
browsers.
Real-Time Sync: Firebase delivers immediate data updates when connected to the
internet.

Future Enhancements


Offline Verification: Support for areas with poor connectivity using PouchDB.



Dedicated Mobile Application: Faster access and improved usability.
